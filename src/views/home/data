*History of the United Galactic Confederation*

Millenniums ago humanity’s space exploration rush triggered a resonating sequence 
of events the echoed throughout the galaxy. Little did these humans know but back
then they set the galaxy on an irrevocable course of conflict. As centuries passed
by the human civilization spread across the galaxy as they colonized planets.
By now humans had put their differences apart and a coherent human civilization
was established with a earth effectively serving as humanity’s governing capital.
Flourishing under peace, humanity was destined to meet an adversary,
soon humanity came across the Hocans an equally sophisticated civilization 
with their own colonial galatic empire.  The two powers in an attempt to exert dominance,
slipped into a vicious and chaotic war, that ravaged the entirety of the galaxy as billions perished.
However, centuries of conflict didn’t sit well with the younger generations who were sick of war.
Eager for peace the new young leaders decided to unite the empires by establishing
what is now known as the United Galactic Confederation.

*Present time UGC* 

The United Galactic Confederation is a sophisticated multiplanetary civilization,
having the ultimate goal of uniting the entire solana galaxy under one flag.
At the core of this civilization comes a great emphasis on technological and economic superiority.
As such the UGC evolved to be as efficient as possible embracing the best technologies,
and educating the population to the highest standard while maintaining a high living standard
for its citizens. Transparency and democracy being the pillars of the governance mechanism at UGC,
every voice within the empire is heard with every citizen being granted the right to directly vote on public matters. Reining over a vast area the UGC maintains orderly conduct through a complex and intricate system of governing bodies and institutions.
